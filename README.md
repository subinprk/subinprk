# Subin Park's GitHub

Welcome!  
I'm Subin Park, an engineering student with a strong background in **system-level programming** and a growing interest in **low-level machine learning systems**.  
My work mainly focuses on **memory management**, **parallel processing**, and **efficient low-level computation**, often implementing projects **without relying on external libraries** to build a deeper understanding of system behavior.

## Key Projects

### Robotics and Embedded Systems (C++/ROS)

- **LiDAR Obstacle Detection (MORAI Simulator + ROS)**  
  Real-time LiDAR point cloud processing and object clustering.  
  Focus: Sensor data subscription, RANSAC plane fitting, Euclidean clustering, ROS modular design.

---

### Network and Systems Programming (C++)

- **Webserv**  
  Implementation of a lightweight HTTP/1.1 web server in C++.  
  Focus: Low-level socket programming, select-based I/O multiplexing, manual HTTP request parsing and response generation without using high-level frameworks.  
  Achieved concurrent client handling and static content serving with minimal external dependencies.

### Machine Learning (Python)

- **Machine Learning Coursework** (Inha Univ. EEC3400)
  Covered topics including convex optimization, kernel methods (SVM, Kernel PCA), unsupervised learning (Spectral Clustering, GMM, EM),
  and theoretical foundations (MLE, MAP, Lagrangian duality).
  Implemented and analyzed models in Python using NumPy and scikit-learn.

- **Deep Learning Coursework (PyTorch)** (Inha Univ. ECE4456)
  Neural network architecture design and training for image classification.  
  Focus: regularization techniques, performance evaluation.

- **Dive into Deep Learning (D2L.ai) Study**  
  Hands-on deep learning experiments using PyTorch and theoretical study.  
  Focus: Understanding from low-level tensor operations to network optimization.

### System Programming (C language)

- **minishell**  
  A minimal Unix shell built in C.  
  Focus: Lexer/parser construction, abstract syntax tree (AST) execution, built-in command support, signal handling.

- **philosopher**  
  Classic Dining Philosophers problem solved with multithreading (pthreads).  
  Focus: Mutex usage, deadlock prevention, precise thread synchronization.

- **fdf**  
  3D wireframe visualization of terrain data using 2D projection techniques.  
  Focus: 3D to 2D transformation, matrix operations, Bresenhamâ€™s line algorithm.

etc...

## Skills and Interests

- **Languages:** C, C++, Python
- **Key Areas:** System programming, memory management, network programming, parallel/concurrent programming, low-level ML systems
- **Mindset:**  
  - Build from first principles.  
  - Understand system internals.  
  - Optimize for efficiency and clarity.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between low-level system understanding and machine learning execution efficiency.  
Currently, I'm exploring compiler technologies (TVM, MLIR) and hardware-aware ML optimization as future research directions.
