# Subin Park's GitHub

Welcome!  
I'm Subin Park, an engineering student with a strong background in **system-level programming** and a growing interest in **low-level machine learning systems**.  
My work mainly focuses on **memory management**, **parallel processing**, and **efficient low-level computation**, often implementing projects **without relying on external libraries** to build a deeper understanding of system behavior.

## Key Projects

### Robotics and Embedded Systems (C++/ROS)

- **LiDAR Obstacle Detection (MORAI Simulator + ROS)**  
  Real-time LiDAR point cloud processing and object clustering.  
  Focus: Sensor data subscription, RANSAC plane fitting, Euclidean clustering, ROS modular design.

---

### Network and Systems Programming (C++)

- **Webserv**  
  Implementation of a lightweight HTTP/1.1 web server in C++.  
  Focus: Low-level socket programming, select-based I/O multiplexing, manual HTTP request parsing and response generation without using high-level frameworks.  
  Achieved concurrent client handling and static content serving with minimal external dependencies.

### Machine Learning (Python)

- **Deep Learning Coursework (PyTorch)**  
  Neural network architecture design and training for image classification.  
  Focus: regularization techniques, performance evaluation.

- **Dive into Deep Learning (D2L.ai) Study**  
  Hands-on deep learning experiments using PyTorch and theoretical study.  
  Focus: Understanding from low-level tensor operations to network optimization.

### System Programming (C language)

- **libft**  
  Re-implementation of standard C library functions from scratch.  
  Focus: Robust string manipulation, memory operations, no external dependencies.

- **get_next_line**  
  Implementation of buffered line-by-line file reading.  
  Focus: Dynamic memory management, buffer reallocation, multi-file descriptor handling.

- **ft_printf**  
  Custom `printf` function with full format specifier support.  
  Focus: Manual parsing, variadic argument handling using `va_list`.

- **push_swap**  
  Sorting algorithms using only a limited set of stack operations.  
  Focus: Algorithmic optimization for minimal operation count, efficient data structures.

- **pipex**  
  Recreation of Unix pipe functionality using process forking and file descriptor manipulation.  
  Focus: Process control (`fork`, `execve`), pipe management, I/O redirection.

- **minishell**  
  A minimal Unix shell built in C.  
  Focus: Lexer/parser construction, abstract syntax tree (AST) execution, built-in command support, signal handling.

- **philosopher**  
  Classic Dining Philosophers problem solved with multithreading (pthreads).  
  Focus: Mutex usage, deadlock prevention, precise thread synchronization.

- **fdf**  
  3D wireframe visualization of terrain data using 2D projection techniques.  
  Focus: 3D to 2D transformation, matrix operations, Bresenhamâ€™s line algorithm.

## Skills and Interests

- **Languages:** C, C++, Python
- **Key Areas:** System programming, memory management, network programming, parallel/concurrent programming, low-level ML systems
- **Mindset:**  
  - Build from first principles.  
  - Understand system internals.  
  - Optimize for efficiency and clarity.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between low-level system understanding and machine learning execution efficiency.  
Currently, I'm exploring compiler technologies (TVM, MLIR) and hardware-aware ML optimization as future research directions.
